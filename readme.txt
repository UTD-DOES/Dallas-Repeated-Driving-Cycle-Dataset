# DRD (Dallas repeated driving cycle dataset)

DRD: A repeated driving cycle dataset generated in the Dallas area, aiming to simulate a daily commuting route and serves as a base for further energy management study. 

DRD captures the GPS trajectories of a fixed driver using an internal combustion engine vehicle (Nissan, Altima 2012). The data was collected using a GPS logger (brand:  Garmin, model: eTrex 10) from Dem, 2020 to Jan, 2021.
The fixed urban route is approximately 25 km, which consists of an expressway test of 5 kilometers and a local urban road test of 20 kilometers. The whole trip takes around 30 minutes to finish. 

Both the original GPX data and the CSV data after preliminary processing were provided. The GPX data can be read through the open-source software 'GPS track editor' or 'GPXsee'. Please find below the download link for these software.

Version 1,  03/01/2021, only the GPX and CSV data are uploaded. The video and image of the driving route, especially at the intersections,  will be available in the future.
